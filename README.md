## The idea

Build distributed UI system with typescript and storybook.

## Running the project locally

After cloning the project navigate to it and run `yarn install`

After installing run `yarn sb` to start storybook

## Contributing

Create branch and open pull request

Structural changes need to be properly indexed for rollup to pack them.

After changes are approved run `yarn rbl` to build the current state of the application

Run `npm publish` to make changes available outside
